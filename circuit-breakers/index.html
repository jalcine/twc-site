        <h4>Circuit Breakers is a gathering for organizers and activists in the tech industry to come together and learn, build community, strategize, and recognize our collective power. This conference is organized by volunteers from across the tech labor movement, including many central organizers from last year’s Labor Notes <a href="https://labornotes.org/techcon2023">Tech Labor Conference</a>.</h4>

            <p>We are currently seeking session proposals and invite anyone with experience to submit an idea before our August 2nd deadline. The topics of interest include but are not limited to shop floor organizing tactics, building unions, negotiating contracts, fighting against the harms of tech, the economic moment for tech organizing, opposing militarism and war, and enacting international solidarity with Palestine. This conference will be a place to share our experiences and learn from one another. Mark your calendar, and consider submitting a session proposal!</p>

      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>We believe the tech labor movement must be worker-led, wall to wall, rooted in experience, international, militant, class struggle. These strengths are critical for workers to oppose social harms such as colonial oppression, surveillance, and war.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <h5>When is the conference?</h5>
        <p>Circuit Breakers is targeted to happen in October 2024. It will be a 2 day event over a weekend, and we will annonce a firm date shortly!</p>        
        <h5>Who is this conference for?</h5>
        <p>This is a conference for rank-and-file workers in tech who have direct experience organizing or who want to get more involved in organizing. This gathering is not for general observers like journalists or researchers. If you fall into one of these categories, you might be eligible if you have significant ties to tech organizing or the labor movement and consider yourself, broadly speaking, a participant or supporter. If you are unsure, we encourage you to reach out to confirm if this conference is for you.</p>
